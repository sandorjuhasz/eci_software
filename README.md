Structure of the repository:

`code` : codes for data preparation, modelling and figures -- the codes build on each other and are therefore numbered<br>
`data` : folder for raw data sources<br>
`outputs` : collection of processed datasets and regression outputs <br>
`figures` : folder for polished figures<br>
